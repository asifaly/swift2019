<A NAME="bropdf"></A><H2>The Browser Does Not Display PDF Files, or Links between PDF Files Do Not Work</H2>
<P>To be able to read PDF documents inside a web browser Adobe Reader needs to be installed. Adobe Reader
includes a plug-in to enable web browsers to display inter-linked PDF files inside the browser window. The installation of this plug-in only happens during the Adobe Reader installation procedure. If PDF documents are not being displayed inside the browser window, we recommend that you download and install the most recent version of Adobe Reader from Adobe's web site and then stop and re-start 
your browser.</P>

<P>On UNIX, you should also take care that the Acrobat Reader bin directory is in the path. Doing so will usually solve the problem. If it does not please see the Adobe Reader's readme file for more detailed troubleshooting instructions.</P>
